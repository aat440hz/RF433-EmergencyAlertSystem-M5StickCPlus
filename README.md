Emergency Alert System
This Remote Alarm System is a versatile and adaptable solution designed to provide remote assistance and security in various situations. This system can be particularly useful for individuals with disabilities, the elderly, or anyone in need of a reliable means of sending an emergency alert. It is versatile and can be customized with different hardware components to suit your specific needs.

Overview
The Remote Alarm System consists of two main components:

Transmitter Device

This device is equipped with a button and can be connected to a constant power source for reliability.
When the button is pressed, it sends a wireless signal to the receiver device to trigger an alert.

Receiver Device

The receiver is also connected to a constant power source and is equipped with features such as a loudspeaker and flashing lights.
When it receives an alert signal from the transmitter, it activates a warning system to alert caregivers or responders.

Key Features
Easy to Use: The transmitter device is designed for easy operation, making it suitable for individuals with limited mobility or other special needs.

Customizable Alerts: The receiver device can be configured to emit loud sounds and flashing lights, ensuring that the alert is noticed promptly.

Versatile Applications: This system can be adapted for various scenarios, including home care, medical facilities, or anywhere remote assistance may be required.
